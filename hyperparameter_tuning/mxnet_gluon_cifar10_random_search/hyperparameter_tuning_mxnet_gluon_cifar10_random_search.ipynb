    "Selecting the right hyperparameter values for your machine learning model can be difficult.  The right answer is dependent on your data; some algorithms have many different hyperparameters that can be tweaked; some are very sensitive to the hyperparameter values selected; and most have a non-linear relationship between model fit and hyperparameter values.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a variety of strategies to select hyperparameter values.  Some scientists use domain knowledge, heuristics, intuition, or manual experimentation; others use brute force searches; and some build meta models to predict what performant hyperparameter values may be.  But regardless of the method, it usually requires a specialized skill set.  Meanwhile, most scientists themselves would prefer to be creating new models rather than endlessly refining an old one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon SageMaker can ease this process with Automatic Model Tuning.  This technique uses Gaussian Process regression to predict which hyperparameter values may be most effective at improving fit, and Bayesian optimization to balance exploring the hyperparameter space (so that a better predictive model for hyperparameters can be built) and exploiting specific hyperparameter values when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other popular methods of hyperparameter optimization include brute force methods like random search.  Despite sounding naive, this is often very competitive.  However, we've found SageMaker's Automatic Model Tuning to provide better fits in fewer job runs, resulting in a better model with less time spent and at a lower cost.  This notebook will compare the two methods in more detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "SageMaker's Automatic Model Tuning works with SageMaker's built-in algorithms, pre-built deep learning frameworks, and the bring your own algorithm container options.  But, for this example, let's stick with the MXNet framework, a ResNet-34 convolutional neural network, and the [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) image dataset.  For more background, please see the [MXNet CIFAR-10 example notebook](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-sagemaker-examples/blob/master/sagemaker-python-sdk/mxnet_gluon_cifar10/mxnet_cifar10_with_gluon.ipynb).\n",
