    "Direct marketing, either through mail, email, phone, etc., is a common tactic to acquire customers.  Because resources and a customer's attention is limited, the goal is to only target the subset of prospects who are likely to engage with a specific offer.  Predicting those potential customers based on readily available information like demographics, past interactions, and environmental factors is a common machine learning problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook presents an example problem to predict if a customer will enroll for a term deposit at a bank, after one or more phone calls.  The steps include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Preparing your Amazon SageMaker notebook\n",
    "* Downloading data from the internet into Amazon SageMaker\n",
    "* Investigating and transforming the data so that it can be fed to Amazon SageMaker algorithms\n",
    "* Estimating a model using the Gradient Boosting algorithm\n",
    "* Evaluating the effectiveness of the model\n",
    "* Setting the model up to make on-going predictions\n",

    "_This notebook was created and tested on an ml.m4.xlarge notebook instance._\n",

    "Let's start by specifying:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The S3 bucket and prefix that you want to use for training and model data.  This should be within the same region as the Notebook Instance, training, and hosting.\n",
    "- The IAM role arn used to give training and hosting access to your data. See the documentation for how to create these.  Note, if more than one role is required for notebook instances, training, and/or hosting, please replace the boto regexp with a the appropriate full IAM role arn string(s)."

    "Cleaning up data is part of nearly every machine learning project.  It arguably presents the biggest risk if done incorrectly and is one of the more subjective aspects in the process.  Several common techniques include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Handling missing values: Some machine learning algorithms are capable of handling missing values, but most would rather not.  Options include:\n",
    " * Removing observations with missing values: This works well if only a very small fraction of observations have incomplete information.\n",
    " * Removing features with missing values: This works well if there are a small number of features which have a large number of missing values.\n",
    " * Imputing missing values: Entire [books](https://www.amazon.com/Flexible-Imputation-Missing-Interdisciplinary-Statistics/dp/1439868247) have been written on this topic, but common choices are replacing the missing value with the mode or mean of that column's non-missing values.\n",
    "* Converting categorical to numeric: The most common method is one hot encoding, which for each feature maps every distinct value of that column to its own feature which takes a value of 1 when the categorical feature is equal to that value, and 0 otherwise.\n",
    "* Oddly distributed data: Although for non-linear models like Gradient Boosted Trees, this has very limited implications, parametric models like regression can produce wildly inaccurate estimates when fed highly skewed data.  In some cases, simply taking the natural log of the features is sufficient to produce more normally distributed data.  In others, bucketing values into discrete ranges is helpful.  These buckets can then be treated as categorical variables and included in the model when one hot encoded.\n",
    "* Handling more complicated data types: Mainpulating images, text, or data at varying grains is left for other notebook templates.\n",

    "Another question to ask yourself before building a model is whether certain features will add value in your final use case.  For example, if your goal is to deliver the best prediction, then will you have access to that data at the moment of prediction?  Knowing it's raining is highly predictive for umbrella sales, but forecasting weather far enough out to plan inventory on umbrellas is probably just as difficult as forecasting umbrella sales without knowledge of the weather.

    "When building a model whose primary goal is to predict a target value on new data, it is important to understand overfitting.  Supervised learning models are designed to minimize error between their predictions of the target value and actuals, in the data they are given.  This last part is key, as frequently in their quest for greater accuracy, machine learning models bias themselves toward picking up on minor idiosyncrasies within the data they are shown.  These idiosyncrasies then don't repeat themselves in subsequent data, meaning those predictions can actually be made less accurate, at the expense of more accurate predictions in the training phase.\n",

There are several different ways of operationalizing this, holdout validation, cross-validation, leave-one-out validation, etc.  For our purposes, we'll simply randomly split the data into 3 uneven groups.  The model will be trained on 70% of data, it will then be evaluated on 20% of data to give us an estimate of the accuracy we hope to have on \"new\" data, and 10% will be held back as a final testing dataset which will be used later on."
